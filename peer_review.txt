Is the Github documentation - commits and README - thorough and descriptive?
-You should add "bundle install" as the first step in the instructions.
-You should add "migrate the DB" after create.

Is there good spec coverage?
16 specs WOW

Do all specs pass?
4 failures

Is the application logic clear and easy to navigate?
Really good, really cleve game mechanics.

Is the site user-friendly?
There could be more instruction on how to progress through game board.

Are there opportunities for refactoring?
Perhaps in .scout method. Also the game board had a bunch of code that maaaybe could be DRYer.

What features stand out?
Cool game mechanics, the board.

What features could be improved?
Add instructions, and the eventual inventory. After a session is played, the game board should reset. For example, if you log in as someone different after playing a round, the board still shows the game from the last user.

Do you have any additional constructive criticism or positive feedback to share?
SO GREAT
